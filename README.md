## Usage

Install the `torch-btg` package:

```
pip install torch-btg
```

Use the desired loss in your code, for example,

- `F1-loss`:
```
from torch_btg.loss import f1_loss
...
criterion = fb_loss(beta=1.0)
...
```

- `Accuracy loss`:
```
from torch_btg.loss import accuracy_loss
...
criterion = accuracy_loss()
...
```

## Development

### Setup

```
python3 -m pip install --user tox
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

#### Run tests

```
tox
```

#### Build

```
python3 -m build
```

#### Publish

```
python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
